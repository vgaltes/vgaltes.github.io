      <description>Congratulations! Your startup is starting to bring attention to many people and you&amp;rsquo;re starting to have clients from different countries and continents. But your lambdas and API gateway are still in your initial region, and that might add some latency to some users. Apart from that, you want to increase the reliability of your system. So, you decide to go multi-region. Can you do that easily? In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to do that.</description>

      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re doing something more than a few tests with Lambda and API Gateway, there will be a time where you will like to stop using the AWS-created endpoints for your APIs and start using your own domain. You know, instead of telling your clients, &amp;ldquo;please, go to https://lk7z14x78h.execute-api.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/dev/helloWorld&amp;quot;, you will like to point them to something like &amp;ldquo;api.authenticatedservices.net/helloWorld&amp;rdquo;. In this article, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how to do that.
