      <description>When you start working on a new project, there are a couple of things that you should try to discover as fast as you can: the shape of the code and the internals of the team you&amp;rsquo;re working with.
You can (and should) try to discover both of them using conversations (at the end, developing software is having conversations (link in spanish)). But it&amp;rsquo;s also useful to try to discover this things for yourself, to confirm what the conversations are saying, or to bo a little bit faster.</description>

      <description>In the last few weeks I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on Crystal Gazer, a nodejs console application to gather information from your Git repository. You can find it on GitHub and on NPM.
One of the things I&amp;rsquo;d like to do is to track the evolution of a function. Has it been modified a lot? How many people has been working on it? Is the function too long?
To answer the first question, what we could do is rely on the git log -L:function:file command to give us all the changes a function has suffered.</description>
